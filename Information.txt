This repository is a collection of small projects created for different calendar events and special occasions. Each event (like festivals, holidays, and important days) is represented with a unique mini-project to showcase creativity and frontend development skills.

The goal of this repo is to practice, learn, and share simple projects built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular, while celebrating important days through code.
